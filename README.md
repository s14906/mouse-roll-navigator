# Mouse Roll Navigator
A very simple program which imitates the computer mouse side buttons (4 and 5), typically present in gaming mice.
Can be used to bring this functionality to generic office mice or to provide just another navigation option in a web browser or another program.

## Installation
Clone the repository, run "mvn install", go to /target folder and run the .jar file with dependencies (either double click to run or use the command line).
There is no GUI for simplicity, so it is going to run in the background.

## Usage
When the program is running, press down the mouse roller and drag the mouse to the left for "Back" or to the right for "Forward" navigation. 
This action is going to be registered as a single press of button 4 or 5. Release the roller and press again to repeat.
